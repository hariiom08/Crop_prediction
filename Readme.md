This is my Machile learing model

<b> CROP PREDICTION MODEL </b>

In this project i used Random Forest Classfier which is form Supervised ensemble learing.

RandomforestClassifier is a ML model that is used to make prediction of crops in this model.

Libraries that are used in this model are-
Pandas for data manupulation
scikit-learn for ML Random Forest Classifier.
pickle for saving  file.

In this i used a csv file Crop_recommendation.csv that have all data on which 
the model is trained.

For web application i mostly used Flask for hosting
and html and css for making web page mostly done with Curson AI.

In this model we have different parameters like-
Sodium,vPhosphorus potassium, temprature,pH value of soil, humidity, rainfall.
on the basis of this parameters model Predicts conditons are best suited for the which crop.
